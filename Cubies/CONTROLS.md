# Controls

This project works in different modes. We'll name only the important ones, as there are many that were
left for debugging purposes. They are:

- VIEW
- CUT
- HINGE

# Switching Modes

- `SHIFT + Q`: VIEW mode
- `SHIFT + A`: CUT mode
- `SHIFT + H`: HINGE mode

# Controls in each mode

## VIEW mode

- Mouse: Rotate Camera
- W: Move Forward
- A: Move Left
- S: Move Right
- D: Move Back
- Q: Move Up
- E: Move Down

## CUT mode

- Click an edge to highlight it yellow

## HINGE mode

- Once a purple edge appears, click that to split the polycube into two colors. Click a face to see an unfolding happen.
